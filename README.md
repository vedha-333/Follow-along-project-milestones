Creating Endpoint to Display All Products
Created a new API endpoint to retrieve and display all the products from the database.

// product.router.js
router.get("/get-products", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const products = await ProductModel.find({});
    res.status(200).send({
      success: true,
      message: "Products retrieved successfully",
      data: products,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send({
      success: false,
      message: "Error retrieving products",
      error: error.message,
    });
  }
});
Integrating the New Route
Added the /get-products route in product.router.js to handle the retrieval of all product data. This route queries the database and returns a list of products.

const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();
const ProductModel = require("./models/ProductModel");

// Endpoint to fetch all products
router.get("/get-products", async (req, res) => {
  // Logic to fetch products
});

module.exports = router;
Integration with Server

const productRoutes = require("./routes/product.router");
app.use("/api/products", productRoutes);
Project Milestone 12
