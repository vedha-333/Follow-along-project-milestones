    // Logic to store the product in the database

### Creating Endpoint to Display All Products
- Created a new API endpoint to retrieve and display all the products from the database.
  javascript
  // product.router.js
  router.get("/get-products", async (req, res) => {
    try {
      const products = await ProductModel.find({});
      res.status(200).send({
        success: true,
        message: "Products retrieved successfully",
        data: products,
      });
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(500).send({
        success: false,
        message: "Error retrieving products",
        error: error.message,
      });
    }
  });
  

### Integrating the New Route
- Added the /get-products route in product.router.js to handle the retrieval of all product data. This route queries the database and returns a list of products.
  javascript
  const express = require("express");
  const router = express.Router();
  const ProductModel = require("./models/ProductModel");

  // Endpoint to fetch all products
  router.get("/get-products", async (req, res) => {
    // Logic to fetch products
  });

  module.exports = router;
  

### Integration with Server
- Ensure the product.router.js file is properly imported and used in the main server file:
  javascript
  const productRoutes = require("./routes/product.router");
  app.use("/api/products", productRoutes);
  

## Project Milestone 12
